                        RNAlater
                        ice
Gut microbiota were sampled by non-invasively fecal collection. Stool samples were taken in duplicate by coring out feces with inverted sterile 1 mL pipette tips. These tips were then deposited in 15 mL Falcon tubes, and RNAlater was added to the tubes for meta-transcriptomic sequencing. Samples were collected in two minutes at home and stored temporarily at −20 ℃. Samples were then transported on ice to the laboratory within 2 hours, and then stored in −80 ℃ freezers immediately.
